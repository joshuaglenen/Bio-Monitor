# Smartguard
Smart Mouthguard Biosensing Platform

This project explores the design of a next-generation smart mouthguard for non-invasive health and performance monitoring. The intraoral form factor provides access to saliva, enabling both biochemical sensing of hydration/lactate and physiological monitoring of heart rate/oral temperature/motion.
